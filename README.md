## AngularJs-bikeRental-cart-with-localStorage

Implemented pushing data between two carts (from one array into another).

Here I used **localStorage**, to display pushed Cart content even after page refresh. LocalStorage stores data locally within the user's browser without affecting the website performance. It is more secure, and large amount of data can be stored locally. Earlier cookies were used to store data.
